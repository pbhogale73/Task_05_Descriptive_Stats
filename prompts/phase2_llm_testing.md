# Phase 2: Complex LLM Testing Results
## Syracuse Women's Basketball 2023-24 Analysis

### Advanced Prompt Testing (Claude Analysis)

---

**Prompt 5: Team Offense vs Defense**
**Question**: "Was the team stronger on offense or defense? Provide evidence using points per game and opponent points."

**Claude's Response**: 
Based on the individual player statistics provided, I can analyze offensive capabilities but cannot make a complete offense vs defense comparison. 

**Offensive Strengths Identified:**
- Strong primary scorer: Dyaisha Fair (22.3 PPG)
- Efficient shooting: Saniaa Wilson (56.8% FG%)
- Good ball control: Dyaisha Fair (1.73 AST/TO ratio)
- Solid rebounding: Alyssa Latham (224 total rebounds)

**Limitation Noted**: To properly compare offense vs defense, additional data needed:
- Team points per game
- Opponent points allowed per game  
- Team defensive rebounds, steals, blocks
- Defensive efficiency metrics

**Status**: Partially answerable - need more team-level data

**Prompt 6: Most Well-Rounded Player**
**Question**: "Which player had the most well-rounded performance across scoring, rebounding, and defense?"

**Claude's Response**:
Based on available statistics, **Dyaisha Fair** appears to be the most well-rounded player:

**Evidence**:
- **Scoring**: 22.3 PPG (team leader)
- **Playmaking**: 1.73 AST/TO ratio (best on team)
- **Leadership**: Likely high minutes played as primary scorer
- **Efficiency**: Maintains good ball control despite high usage

**Limitation**: Complete analysis requires:
- Individual rebounding stats per player
- Defensive stats (steals, blocks, defensive rebounds)
- Minutes played for context

**Status**: Reasonably answerable with current data

**Prompt 7: Coaching Strategy for 2 More Wins**
**Question**: "If the coach wanted to win 2 more games next season, should they focus on improving offense or defense, and why?"

**Claude's Strategic Analysis**:
Based on basketball analytics principles and available data:

**Recommendation: Focus on DEFENSE**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Offensive Foundation Solid**: 
   - Already have elite scorer (Fair: 22.3 PPG)
   - Good shooting efficiency (Wilson: 56.8%)
   - Decent ball security (1.73 AST/TO ratio)

2. **Defensive Impact Greater**:
   - Defense typically has higher correlation with winning close games
   - Easier to improve team defense than find additional elite scorers
   - Marginal defensive improvements often yield 2-3 win improvements

3. **Data Suggests Focus Areas**:
   - Improve defensive rebounding (build around Latham's 224 rebounds)
   - Develop team defensive systems
   - Focus on limiting opponent easy baskets

**Status**: ✅ Strategic reasoning possible with available data

**Prompt 8: Clutch Player Priority**
**Question**: "Which one player should the coach prioritize to turn close games into wins?"

**Claude's Response**:
**Priority Player: Dyaisha Fair**

**Justification**:
- **Primary Scorer**: 22.3 PPG indicates clutch scoring ability
- **Ball Security**: 1.73 AST/TO ratio shows she can handle pressure
- **Versatility**: Likely creates for others while being primary option
- **Experience**: As leading scorer, probably already in clutch situations

**Development Focus**:
- Late-game decision making
- Clutch shooting under pressure
- Drawing fouls in final minutes
- Leadership in pressure moments

**Status**: Well-reasoned with available data

---

**Prompt 9: First vs Second Half Performance**
**Question**: "How does the team's performance in the first half of games compare to the second half?"

**Claude's Response**:
**Analysis Impossible with Current Dataset**

**Required Data Missing**:
- Half-by-half scoring statistics
- Player performance by game segments
- Team efficiency by halves
- Fatigue/substitution patterns

**Recommendation**: This question requires game-level or segment-level data not available in season totals.

**Status**: Cannot answer - need different data granularity

**Summary of Complex Prompt Testing**

| Prompt | Status | Reasoning Quality | Data Limitations |
|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Offense vs Defense | ⚠️ Partial | Good | Need team defense stats |
| Well-Rounded Player | ✅ Good | Solid | Minor - need individual defense |
| Coaching Strategy | ✅ Excellent | Strong reasoning | None significant |
| Clutch Player | ✅ Good | Well-justified | None significant |
| Half Performance | ❌ Impossible | N/A | Wrong data granularity |

**Key Insights from Phase 2**

1. **LLM Reasoning Quality**: Strong strategic thinking when data supports analysis
2. **Data Limitations**: Season totals insufficient for some temporal/situational questions
3. **Best Performance**: Strategic/coaching questions where reasoning matters most
4. **Failure Points**: Questions requiring data not in the dataset

---

**Recommendations for Future Testing**

1. **Expand Dataset**: Add team-level defensive stats, game-by-game data
2. **Test Other LLMs**: Compare Claude vs GPT-4o vs Gemini on same prompts
3. **Visual Analytics**: Request charts/graphs from LLMs
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Test different phrasings for failed prompts
